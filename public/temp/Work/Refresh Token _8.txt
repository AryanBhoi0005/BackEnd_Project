Refresh Token 
=>View video 16 again 

->There are two types of token 
  1.Access   -Short lived
  2.Refresh  -Long lived
->They are generated in the same way the only 
  difference is the time of expiry 

->While calling the DB check whether it is expensive 
  or not 

->While logging out we can't find userID by asking him 
  to input data again in case of LogIn, So we design our 
  own middleware

=>When a user logs out we have to clear the cookies and 
  also reset the access tokens
=>Cookie is used to access the cookies 
=>Req has Access to the cookies

=>To the changes made you can go to GitHub and check for 
  commits made to it 

=>Before logging in remember to register first 

=>Access token are short lived and present with user
=>Refresh token are saved in DB and helps to keep 
  session on 
=>Session token or session storage are used to refresh 
  the session everytime access token expires we get a 
  session timeout and a mssg appears and we refresh 
  the session and so new access token along with 
  refresh token is called other than logging in again 
  and matches with refresh token in the DB and session 
  continues and refresh token is updated 

=>Verify jwt is used to decode the token as token 
  received by DB is raw decoded token while received 
  by the user is encrypted one so we need to decode it

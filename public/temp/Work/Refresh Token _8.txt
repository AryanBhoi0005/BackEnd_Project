Refresh Token 
=>View video 16 again 

->There are two types of token 
  1.Access   -Short lived
  2.Refresh  -Long lived
->They are generated in the same way the only 
  difference is the time of expiry 

->While calling the DB check whether it is expensive 
  or not 

->While logging out we can't find userID by asking him 
  to input data again in case of LogIn, So we design our 
  own middleware

=>When a user logs out we have to clear the cookies and 
  also reset the access tokens
=>Cookie is used to access the cookies 
=>Req has Access to the cookies

Connecting Database
------------------------------------------------
=>.env is an environment variable and import it 
  as early as possible and try to implement it  
  in index.js so as soon as the first file is  
  loaded it is executed
->0.0.0.0/0 is allow everyone IP however in production we dont't allow allow from anywhere 
->If we didn't add a user we can add a user who  
 has all access to DB

=>Remove the ending slash from URL

=>There are 2 ways of executing DB
  1.As index.js is first file to be started  
    directly keep DB connection in it
 2.Create a separate folder and keep the  
   connection in it and then import it into  
   index.js

->Install all mongoose, express, dotenv
=>Database is always at another continent
=>Always use try and catch or promises as there    
  will be many issues while connecting DB

--------------------------------------------------
While Connecting DB keep 2 things in mind
1.Use try and catch and promises 
2.Use async and await 
------------------------------------------------
=>Never connect a DB with a single line
=>We can immediately execute a function using 
  ()() = iffy
=>Always start ur iffy with a ; as it will throw 
  an error if previous line is not ended with ;
=>Ahead of DB string also use DB name
-----------------------------------------------
=>Creating index.js inside db folder
=>Process is current ongoing process
=>connection.host helps us to know which host 
  are we connecting to host,server etc
----------------------------------------------

=>When using import dotenv make changes in package.json too 
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon -r dotenv/config --experimental-json-modules src/index.js"
  },
------------------------------------------------=>While importing and exporting dont't just use constants use constants.js
------------------------------------------------
**Three Steps to remember**
1.Keep ur DB name same in both MongoDb and name 
  created in constants
2.Allows remove "\" from end of Mongo String as  
  it takes in as a string and may throw a error 
  while parsing
3.If parser error check for String typed in or 
 code for string $ and & and much more if parser  
 error then always go for MongoString

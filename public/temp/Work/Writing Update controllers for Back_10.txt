Writing Update controllers for Backend 
--------------------------------------------------------
->Users are the subscribers and the channel they are 
 subscribing are users itself 
->subscription model is created 

->While updating keep one thing in mind that only the 
  logged-in user can update
->With the help of Auth middleware and if the user is 
  logged in we can easily get his info as his info is 
  sent through req.body 
-In Production whenever there is a need to change or 
 update a file always try to keep it in separate 
 controllers as it is easier to manage and helps with 
 network congestion 

--------------------------------------------------------
Subs Model- Every time a New Doc is created 
--------------------------------------------------------
->Both User and Channel are created and referenced by 
  the same User itself
-> Everytime a user subs a channel a new doc is created 
  with its info

**** No of Subs of a channel ****
=> Everytime we have to calculate no of subs of a 
   channel we won't count  the no of subs added but we 
   calculate the "No of doc with the same channel name" 
   as every time a subs is added a new doc is created 
=> No of docs = No of subs

*****No of channels you subscribed*****
=>This time we will select the Doc with same subs or 
  user name as a new doc is created as we sub

File Upload Using Multer
------------------------------------------------
-> File Handling is a task associated with 
   BackEnd
   Engineers
-> File Handling is not majorly done on our own  
   server for that we use AWS and other 

=>Cloudinary is a SDK, It takes file from the 
  user and uploads it on the server however in 
  production lvl we follow 2 step process 
  1.Take file from user and store it in   
    localhost
  2.Upload it to server 
-> We follow this 2 step process so if there is  
   an error while uploading a file we can re-
   attempt it


=>There are two types of file upload [Read Docs]
  1.Multer 
  2.Express File Upload 

=>Go to Cloudinary and choose Node js
->npm i cloudinary and npm i multer

=>As it a reusable code we store it in Util
=>We can also give custom naming 

=>Nodejs FS stands for file System which helps 
  in read, write, upload etc
=>In FS files are Linked and Unlinked and  
  whenever a file is deleted it gets unlinked 
  from Fs but the file is still stored in Fs
-----------------------------------------------

=>Copy Cloudinary configuration from website
=>As key and value is going to be a sensitive 
  data we store it in env file 
=>Then cut and paste the values into env files 
  from Util
=>Then import .env files into Util using
  process.env._NamesOfEnvFilesCreated_
=>There are multiple options available for
  uploading files on Cloudinary
=>We used try and catch block and upload 
  whatever we need

  multiple files and create it as a middleware 
  to call it whenever we need to upload 
  something we can call it 
=> Read about how to upload as well as how and 
   where to store it we can store it in Disk 
   as well as Buffer [Memory Storage]
->Copy Disk Storage code

=>After creating a Middleware we will Route it
  and whenever we want to store it we will can 
  func

Logic Building requires real world feedback 
->Check your logic in POSTMAN

->Getting details from the user involve GET and POST
  req and what data we will be taking in will depend 
  on the User Schema model we have created 
->If user already exist can be taken care of by 
  unique username and email 

=> 
    //Get user details from Frontend 
    //Validation -Not empty
    //Check if User already exist:email,Uname
    //Check for images and Avatar 
    //Upload them to cloudinary, avatar check
    //Create user object - create entry in DB
    // remove password and refresh token  
       //field from response
    //Check for user creation 
    //return response 
--------------------------------------------------

=> If data is coming from "form or json" then we can
  find it in req.body
=>In Postmen "Params" is used to get data from 
  frontend but we use "Body" 
=>In none dropdown list we can also choose form-data
=> x-bound-data is "URL" data
=>raw data means JSON data 
--------------------------------------------------
=>Injecting Middleware

=>As it is a POST req so we will post our data in 
  postmen and it will be highlighted in in terminal
=>For fileHandling we use multer as a middleware and 
  write it just before "/register" route 

=>Express gives us access to req.body
=>Multer gives access to req.files 

---------------------------------------------------
=>Once the file is completely uploaded on cloudinary
  we will also delete it from the localPath
=> ? is used which states if present it returns or   
   else throws null
---------------------------------------------------
=>User.create is used to create a DB to store the values in DB
=>TO check if DB user is created everytime a user is 
 created a ID is used and we can check it

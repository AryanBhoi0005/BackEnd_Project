Writing Update controllers for Backend 
---------------------------------------------------------
->Users are the subscribers and the channel they are 
 subscribing are users itself 
->subscription model is created 

->While updating keep one thing in mind that only the 
  logged-in user can update
->With the help of Auth middleware and if the user is 
  logged in we can easily get his info as his info is 
  sent through req.body 
-In Production whenever there is a need to change or 
 update a file always try to keep it in separate 
 controllers as it is easier to manage and helps with 
 network congestion

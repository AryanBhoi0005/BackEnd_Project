Using Postman
-----------------------------------------------------
->Algorithm are steps to solve large prbs by breaking 
  them into smaller steps 

=>In industries we have share our knowledge with 
  frontend team too called postman collections
=>Here we are using "form data" instead of "raw"
  because in raw we are not provided a option to send 
  files as per needs
=>Make sure to "tick" the box to ensure data is sent
=>we get a option of choosing text or file on the side 
  in a drop down arrow choose file in it while 
  uploading avatar or coverImage
=>Keep the key values the same as mentioned 
=>To check if our images are uploaded got to 
  cloudinary and check for "media explorer" to check 
  the data we have uploaded  
=>The response URL we have received is a public URL
  so we can directly paste the link and view in 
  Browser

->Check for keys which you have to send in the 
  DB object you have created 
----------------------------------------------------
->Copy these from Cloudinary API keys

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dp58psx09
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=317664533928915
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=8Kx7KcH4zQImSdq3OdvCUe5B5PM
--------------------------------------------------

=>Whenever there is ? we get errors such as cannot
  define properties of undefined
=>Array.isArray is used to check if required array is present or not 

----------------------------------------------------
->Using PostMan Collection [VIP]
=>Create new Collection, add name to the url and save
=>Copy the common part of the string
  "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/"
=>Go to environment variables give name, variable 
  name and initial and current value as "String"
=>"No Environment" change it to the folder where you 
  want to share "Folder name"
=>Now go back to collection add the route without 
  common string and in place of it "{{" and we get the 
  option of server or common string
